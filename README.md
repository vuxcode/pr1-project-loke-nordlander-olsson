10/18 - I'm having a bit of trouble currently, it seems I've gotten a bit confused by how to write it.

10/22 - The beginning was a bit easier to structure but as soon as it came to math, it became a bit harder. I've been looking at other places than just vuxcode for better understanding of how I can write the code.

10/29 - It has gotten much easier once I began structuring the systems on which the game will be based on. Both attack, defend and ending the battle have been implemented. Even the levelling system is looking better by each change.

11/08 - Had a bit of trouble with what could be added onto the adventure but finally got around to getting started with the merchant.

11/15 - Found a bug with the healing system that had been there for a while. Fixed it.

12/02 - It has gotten a bit tiring to work on this project with only a few weeks left. My head is just full of new information.

12/06 - I am pretty much finished with the project, it has the implemented system and functions that I planned for. It also has an ending and the structure of the code seems semantic.
